Action: Familiarize students the basics of troubleshooting Linux and ELK.

Condition: Given a classroom environment, student laptops, VMâ€™s, and student handouts.

Standard: Successfully execute commands to check what may be causing issues with ELK or the Linux Host.

PART I (Deleting oversized logsize in /var/log)
****************************************************
	1) Open a CLI as root
	
	2) Run the command to view the size of the /var/log directory:
		du -sh /var/log
		
	3) Over time the /var/log/elasticsearch and /var/log/logstash get very large and cause seruous problems.
	
	4) Create a BASH SCRIPT then a CRON JOB to Delete the contents of the /var/log/logstash.log file or the /var/log/elasticsearch.log
		***HINT - use the command
		
		truncate -s 0 <filename>
	
	4) Students will come up to the front and demonstrate their method to delete the logs.

PART II (General Linux Troubleshooting)
************************************************************************************************
	1) Open a CLI are root
		
	2) the following are basic linux troubleshooting commands. Ensure to read the man pages to have better usage of them
	
		top
		ps aux | <name of process>
		grep -i error /var/log/syslog
		netstat
		ping
		kill
		ifconfig
	
	3) Getting RAM info:
				cat /proc/meminfo

			or if you want to get just the amount of ram you can do:
				cat /proc/meminfo | head -n 1

			Another fun thing to do with ram is actually open it up and take a peek. This next command will show you all the string (plain text) values in ram.
				sudo dd if=/dev/mem | cat | strings
	
	4) Getting CPU info:
		Sometimes in troubleshooting we want to know what processor we are dealing with along with how much cpu is currently being
		used by our OS and programs. We can do this with these two commands.
			cat /proc/cpuinfo
			top
	
	5) Getting Temperature of your CPU:
		Keeping a computer within a safe temperature is the key to maintaining a stable system.
			cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
			
	6) how much hard drive space you have left:
		df -h
		
	7) what hard drives are currently detected:
		fdisk -l
		
	8) Installed Programs
		Ever want to find all the packages that are installed on your system? You can find all the packages and also find
		out why they are on your system. You can even determine what packages depend on them if any.
			Find all installed packages
				dpkg --get-selections | less
				
			Find out why a packages is installed and what depends on it
				aptitude why packagename

			Find out where the package stores all of its files
				dpkg -L packagename
				
	9) list all files open on your system:
		lsof
	
	10) keep an eye on something for awhile:
		watch ls
		watch df -h
		
	11) See if you have any kernel issues:
		dmesg | less

PART III (General ELK Troubleshooting)
************************************************************************************************
	1) Go back and revisit LAB 8 and LAB 11. Most of the time there something wrong with connectivity or processes.
	
	2) ALL else fails reboot
	
	3) USE GOOGLE
