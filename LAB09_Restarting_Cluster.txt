PREFACE:
There are many reasons to have the need to resart the cluster. The most commomn example is when making any configuration changes to Elasicsearch Cluster.
**It is important to note here that the best practice for restarting the Cluster is as follows:
	a. Non-Master/Data nodes (.12, .13)
	b. Master/Data Node (.10)
	c. Client Node (N/A)
	
****************************************************
PART I (Restarting the Elasticsearch Cluster)
****************************************************		
	1) a. Open google chrome by selecting the icon on the Desktop (192.168.1.12 ELK2)
		b. open the Elasticsearch HQ icon on the desktop and connect to the Cluster
	
	2) select the little green tree icon on the top right on the Chrome browser ( this will open up the JSON server interaction)
		a. DISABLE SHARDS:
			PUT /_cluster/settings
			{
				"transient" : {
					"cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "none"
				}
			}
		b. Select the little green arrow button and you will see the response on the right show up as "acknowledge": true,
			
	3) From the Elastic HQ Plugin
		a. Flush all indices by selecting the </>REST button. Select the icon that says "FLUSH".
			You will see a response that says "indices Flushed"
		
	4) From the CLI restart Elasticsearch as root
		a. service elasticsearch restart
			
	5) Verify that the node joins the cluster by checking the HQ plugin in the Browser. The node will be red. then will go
		to blue when joined successfully.
	
	6) Enable shards by selecting the little green tree icon on the top right on the Chrome browser
		a. ENABLE SHARDS:
			PUT /_cluster/settings
			{
				"transient" : {
					"cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "all"
				}
			}
		b. Select the little green arrow button and you will see the response on the right show up as "acknowledge": true,
	
	7.) Verify  the status of the cluster goes back to greem by looking at the HQ Plugin main menu screen
	
	8.) Repeat steps 1-7 for the other Nodes in the cluster!
