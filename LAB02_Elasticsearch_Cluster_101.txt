ACCESSING HQ PLUGIN:

**************
PART I (GUI)
**************
	1) Login to any of the VM's (preferably the Master Node, elk1{.10})
	2) On the Desktop, open the icon labled "elastic HQ" that has a magnifying glass image
	3) On the very top left of the page you will see a text box. By default it loads "http://localhost:9200"
		a. Depending on how the cluster is setup, you would have to put the IP address of where the elasticsearch
		resides. In this case elasticsearch resides on this host. 
		b. SELECT "connect"
	4) This is the main page for the HQ Plugin. Click around and familizaize yourself with this GUI used to manage the ELASTICSEARCH CLuster
	5) SELECT "</> REST"
		a. This is a very powerful section where you run JSON/REST API queries to your elasticsearch cluster to query 
		several important items: IE: cluster health, stats, flush, refresh, etc.
	6) Instructor will demonstrate the rest of the fucntionality of this GUI

**************	
PART II (CLI)
**************
	1) you can run curl commands via the CLI to interact with the cluster.
	2) Open a terminal and run this command:
		curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true'
		curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state'
		curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/stats?human&pretty'
		curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes/stats'
		curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/stats?human&pretty'
		curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
		curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/count
		
**********************************	
PART III (File Location/Commands)
**********************************	
	1) Open Terminal
	2) as Root run the following commands to learn and check the status of Elasticsearch (which runs on top of java)
		This will show you the status of the process elasticsearch:
			service elasticsearch status
			
		This will show you the listening TCP ports listening with the JAVA process:
			netstat -plunt | grep java
			
		This will show you all the process status and information for elasticsearch:
			ps aux | grep elasticsearch
			
		This will show you all the processes on the host, sorted my MEMORY consumption:
			top -o %MEM
			
		This will show you all the established connections, and owner of processes associated with java:
			ss -amp | grep java
	
	3) Lets expore the critical elasticsearch file locations:
		Location Configuration Files:
			/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
		
		Location of the data indexed by default. to change this location you must modify elasticsearch.yml
			/var/lib/elasticsearch/data
		
		Location of environment Variables:
			/etc/default/elasticsearch

		Location of Logs:
			/var/log/elasticsearch

		Location of Plugins:
			/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins

		Location of Scripts:
			/etc/elasticsearch/scripts
