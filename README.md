# ElasticStackAnalystCourse
The material in this repo was built to teach students how to conduct analysis using the Kibana Front End. In addition, the labs are mainly designed to teach students how to:

-Manage Elasticsearch Cluster

-Build custom queries and dashboards on Kibana

-Troubleshoot ELK and critical services

- Linux Concepts

- BRO Intel Framework and BRO overview

** The Notes/Labs are not perfect. The instructions in this repo are best suited for Intermediate Linux Users.

  *==*==* My documents are on GITHUB mostly for me to access them and when I have to teach a course, students can download the content. This is by no means designed for anyone to become an expert on ELK by simply going through this documentation. SELF-TEACH!

*** The Slide Deck for this course is Unclassified, however is not on github. If you want the slide deck, send me an email. Thanks!
